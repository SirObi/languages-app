1. Handle NoneType returns from query

Use one_or_none() function instead of one() for SQLAlchemy queries:

@app.route('/language-families/<int:family_id>')
def showLanguageFamily(family_id):
    '''Renders page for chosen language family'''
    user_name = checkName()
    family = session.query(LanguageFamily).filter_by(id=family_id).one()


2. Create decorators for the following functionality:
- verifying if user logged in
- ensuring requested entity id exists in database
- ensuring user owns a particular entity

3. Make the creator id the id of the currently logged-in user

4. Use SQLALchemy's LargeBinary class to store images in database

5. Use JavaScript to validate user input for each web form

6. Gather feedback on current website layout
